                <h2>About Us</h2>
                <hr>
                <p>In 2020, Greenta was born from a group of university students who shared a bold vision: to reshape the way people approach nutrition through smart, functional, and genuinely natural products.

                    What started as an idea between classes quickly became a mission: to mix science, performance, and taste into a new generation of protein and fit snacks designed for active, ambitious minds.
                    Rooted in Italian excellence, Greenta embodies the values that inspired its founders from the very beginning:
                    
                    <p><strong>• Authenticity</strong> in every ingredient and choice we make.
                    <p><strong>• Performance</strong> - as physical energy, but also as a lifestyle philosophy.</p>
                    <p><strong>• Sustainability</strong>: because true strength grows only from balance with nature.</p> 
                    <p><strong>• Innovation</strong>: turning creativity and research into tangible well-being.</p> From the initial small kitchen experiments to the sophisticated formulae of today, Greenta has remained true to its founding spirit: young, determined, and forward-looking. We are not just a brand; we are an evolution of generations who believe in healthy ambition.
</p>
                <p><strong><h3><u>Our mission</u></h3></strong></p>    
                <p> Our mission is to fuel active and health-conscious lifestyles with natural, protein-rich snacks made in Italy.
                   We craft every product with care, combining clean nutrition, authentic taste, and sustainable Italian ingredients — empowering people to perform better, live better, and feel better every day.
                </p> 
                <p><strong><h3><u>Our vision</u></h3></strong></p>
                   To make Italy a global benchmark for healthy and delicious nutrition, where fitness meets flavor and sustainability.
                </p>
